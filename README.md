# MovieDB Discovery
This is my 2nd playground to get back my hands dirty with ios.

Here I'm building a viewer for The movie DB for showing mainly the popular movie list for now.

I'll add below my todo list:
- Build CoreData stack to hold the movies list
- Build API service skelton with 2 stubs one for retrive the popular list, and one for search by name
- Build the movie ViewModel and the MoviesTableViewController
- support search input and handle input errors
- Build MoviesViewController and show it on cell selection in MoviesTableViewController.
